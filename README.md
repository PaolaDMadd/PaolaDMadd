## Welcome to my github profile
I'am Paola a software developer. I love be active in the dev community and share my "discoveries" with others this is why I like open source.
I learned coding at [codebar London](https://codebar.io/) pair programming workshops, where I had the opportunity to share my knowledge and discuss with other professionals and student. 

I recently started coaching HTML CSS and JS to beginners, each time it's so enriching.

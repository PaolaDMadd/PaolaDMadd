## Welcome to my github profile
I'am Paola a full stack developer. I love be active in the dev community and share my "discoveries" with others this is why I like open source.
I learned coding at [codebar London](https://codebar.io/) pair programming workshops, where I had the opportunity to share my knowledge and discuss with other professionals and student.

I recently started coaching HTML CSS and JS to beginners, each time it's so enriching.
Empowering people is one of the most satisfying experience.

I have spent the last year and half investing in my career change project:  I actively participate in tech meet-ups, workshops and keep up to date with new technologies. 

In October 2020 I joined Futureproof academy to refine my knowledge and upgrade my skills to be more competitive on the market.

Proactive and ‘passionately curious’, I am now seeking a challenging role in the Tech Industry as full stack developer, where I could apply my knowledge.
